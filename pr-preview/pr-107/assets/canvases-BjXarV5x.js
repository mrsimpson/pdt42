## Regional food system

Around the city, about sixty small farms grow vegetables, fruit and herbs. They sell at weekly
markets, to a regional wholesale market and to a handful of restaurants that call them directly.
Value is exchanged every day — but through phone calls, market stalls and a wholesaler that
hides the farms from the kitchens that cook their produce.

## Growing and harvesting

Planning crops, growing them and bringing them in. Seasonal and weather-bound; today planned
against last year's sales rather than against demand.

\`\`\`pdt42
:::arena
id: ar-growing

outcome: The right crops are ready at the right time
steps:

\`\`\`

## Selling the harvest

Finding buyers, agreeing quantities and prices, and getting paid. This is where farms lose most
value: up to a fifth of the harvest is never sold. It is our focus — the cooperative already runs
a market stall and knows both farms and customers, and the only incumbent here is the wholesale
market.

selling.

## Small-scale farmers

Family farms of two to twenty hectares within sixty kilometres. They grow well; selling is what
costs them — time on the phone, trips into town, and the fifth of the harvest nobody buys.
