# pdt42

**Platform design as a language — readable by humans, checkable by machines, guided step by step.**

The [Platform Design Toolkit](https://boundaryless.io/pdt-toolkit/) (PDT) by Boundaryless is a
powerful way to look at ecosystems: who takes part, what they could give each other, which
transactions and learning services a platform should enable, and how to test and grow it. On a
wall, its canvases drift apart within a week. The same entity is spelled three ways, a
transaction appears on one canvas and not on another, and nobody notices.

pdt42 keeps a platform design the way [arc42-language](https://github.com/docToolchain/arc42-language)
keeps an architecture:

- **Human-readable first.** Markdown files (`*.pdt42.md`) with prose explaining _why_, and typed
  `:::blocks` for the structure.
- **One consistent model.** Twenty-five block types, from arenas to growth loops, connected by
  references. The canvases are views over this model, not separate documents.
- **Guided by the method.** `pdt42 guide` walks you through PDT's three phases and twenty steps and
  shows where your design stands.
- **Canvases drawn from the model.** Every chapter places its step's canvas with a `:::canvas`
  block; `pdt42 serve` draws it from the model, and every sticky links to its element.

````markdown
## Farmer ↔ restaurant

High volume, planned months ahead: the relationship that lets farms sow against demand.

```pdt42
:::relationship
id: r-farmer-restaurant
title: Farmer ↔ restaurant
between: e-farmers, e-restaurants
core: yes
:::
```
````

## Try it

```bash
npm install -g @pdt42/cli       # or run any command with npx @pdt42/cli …
pdt42 guide                     # the method, and where your design stands
pdt42 next                      # the step to work on next, and why
pdt42 guide step D1             # one step: file, dependencies, how-to, starter template
pdt42 explain transaction       # one block type
pdt42 validate                  # consistency check
pdt42 diff                      # check a change: block and prose change together
pdt42 serve                     # read it in the browser, live, with its history
```

pdt42 keeps no state of its own. `guide` and `next` work out where the design stands from the
Markdown files on every run: which blocks exist, and which findings are still open. Change a
file and the next step changes with it; the files you commit are the whole design and its
progress.

From a clone, `pnpm install && pnpm build`, then `pnpm pdt42 --dir examples/harvest-commons guide`
runs the CLI from source on the example.

## See it

`pdt42 serve` renders the workspace in the browser and reloads on every change;
`pdt42 build --out site` writes the same as a static site (`--single-file`: one HTML page,
`--with-history`: with the history).

- **Chapters** follow the method: the sidebar lists the phases and steps with their status.
- **Prose and model box.** Click the stripe beside an element's prose to swap it for its model
  box — attributes, incoming references, findings, and every canvas the element appears on.
- **Coming from the PDT?** The site's `canvases/` page puts each original canvas next to
  pdt42's and lists the block and field behind every area of it.
- **Canvases** are drawn from the model, in PDT's colours (yellow services, blue transactions,
  one colour per platform role). Every sticky is a link to its element; `#<file>:el-<id>` opens
  the model box.
- **Agent view** shows the chapter as the source the agent reads and writes.
- **Ids in prose** link to their elements — in text, or as `` `x-weekly-box` ``.
- **Changes.** `serve --diff [<ref>] [--staged]` and `build --diff` open on a summary of the
  change and show it inline in its chapters: changed sections marked, attribute changes word by
  word, the previous version one click away.
- **History.** In a Git repository the sidebar's _History_ lists every commit that touched the
  design, with its change and message; _Browse this version_ opens the whole design as it was.

A chapter without its canvas gets a warning (W011) naming the `:::canvas` block to add:

````markdown
```pdt42
:::canvas
id: cv-board-restaurant
canvas: transactions-board
of: r-farmer-restaurant
:::
```
````

## The method, in the model

| Phase                                              | Steps                                                                                                                                 | Blocks                                                                                                                     |

Every block type has one home chapter: the chapter of the step that creates it. Later steps fill
blocks in there or reference them, and a block found in a later step is still written in its home
chapter. Entities live in the Ecosystem Scan (E2): D1 gives them their role and D2 their portrait,
in place — also when a design skips exploration and starts at D1. `pdt42 guide step <id>` and
`pdt42 explain <type>` name the home chapters.

- [`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md) summarises the PDT as this project reads it.
- [`docs/meta-model.md`](docs/meta-model.md) is generated from the schemas: every block, attribute
  and reference.

## Validation

`pdt42 validate` reports three levels, each rule with its rationale (`pdt42 rules`):

- **Errors: the model is broken.** Duplicate ids (EG01), blocks that cannot be built — unknown
  blocks, missing or invalid attributes, unreadable lines, unclosed blocks (EG02) — blocks
  outside their home chapter (EG03) or outside any section (EG04), references that don't resolve
  (E002: references are mostly optional, but a reference that is set must point to an existing
  element of the right type), more than one platform (E005), invalid canvases (E006).
- **Warnings: the model contradicts the method.** A transaction outside its relationship, an
  experience whose steps involve roles it doesn't list, a learning engine for a stakeholder, an MVP
  without assumptions, a chapter without its canvas — and the conventions every \*42 language
  shares: unknown attributes (WG01), a block without prose above it (WG02), several blocks under
  one heading (WG03), a block outside the ` ```pdt42 ` fence (WG05), an id without its kind's prefix
  (WG08: `e-` for entities, `t-` for transactions … — `pdt42 explain <type>` names it).
- **Hints: the design has a gap the method would fill.** Incomplete portraits, peers missing from
  the motivations matrix, core relationships without transactions, experiences without a business
  model, MVPs that don't test business model, trust and attraction, orphan elements.

An intentional finding is accepted where it occurs: `:::ignore <CODE> <reason> :::` inside a
` ```pdt42 ` fence suppresses the next warning or hint with that code at or after the directive
(WG06 reports a directive that suppresses nothing; errors cannot be ignored, WG07).

`pdt42 diff [<ref> | <a>..<b>] [--staged]` checks a change before it is committed: a block whose
facts changed while the prose explaining it did not (or the other way round) is a finding, exit 1.
`PDT42_CONSISTENT=<base commit>` accepts the findings of a change on purpose.

Every pull request gets a platform design review, as in biz42 and arc42-language
(`.github/workflows/platform-review.yml`, `scripts/platform-review.ts`): for each reviewed
workspace, the change since the merge base is linted and rendered as one self-contained HTML page
(`pdt42 build --diff <base>...HEAD --single-file`), attached to the run, and a comment on the pull
request lists the changed elements and the findings, with a link to the page.

## For agents

pdt42 is built to be driven by a coding agent, with a human in the conversation.
`skills/pdt42/SKILL.md` teaches coding agents the
format and the workflow; the CLI hands them the method one step at a time (`next`,
`guide step`, `explain`, `validate`, most with `--format json`).

A session looks like this: `next` names D1, `guide step D1` briefs it, the agent writes the
chapter, `validate` reports the missing canvas, the agent adds it, and `next` moves on to D2.

## Development

pnpm workspace, TypeScript, [zod](https://zod.dev) schemas as the single source of truth, and
[vite-plus](https://viteplus.dev) (`vp`) for tests, lint, type-check and packaging. pdt42 is a
[cli42](https://github.com/mrsimpson/cli42) language, like arc42-language and biz42: parser,
model builder, validation engine, generic rules, semantic diff, Git history and the shared web
views come from `@cli42/lib`; pdt42 adds its schemas, method rules, methodology and canvases. Work is planned
in `.vibe/` following the EPCC workflow (explore, plan, code, commit).

```bash
pnpm test            # vp test
pnpm check           # vp check: format, lint, types
pnpm --filter @pdt42/web test:e2e  # Playwright: the web view and the review script (after pnpm build)
pnpm build           # web app, CLI bundle (with the web app beside it), landing page
pnpm docs:meta-model # regenerate docs/meta-model.md
pnpm demo            # the demo: walkthrough video, screenshots and CLI session into demo/
pnpm demo:cli        # only the recorded CLI session (demo/cli-session.json)
pnpm site            # landing page + the example, in packages/site/dist
```

The site is served by GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch: `main` at the root, and every pull
request that changes the site (landing page, web app, example or demo) as a preview under
`pr-preview/pr-<number>/`. The preview's link is commented on the pull request and it is removed
when the pull request closes.

The web app uses the shared web view of every \*42 language (`@cli42/lib/web`,
`@cli42/lib/web-react`): React, prose rendered on the server, vite-plugin-singlefile for
`--single-file`. `pnpm demo` is a Playwright project: it records the walkthrough (`demo/demo.webm`)
and takes the site's screenshots.
