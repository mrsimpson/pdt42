# The Platform Design Toolkit, as this project reads it

This is our working summary of the Platform Design Toolkit (PDT) 2.2 by Boundaryless. The meta-model
in [`meta-model.md`](meta-model.md) and the `pdt42 guide` command are built on it. It is written in our own
words and points to the originals, which remain the authoritative source:

## 1. The stance: design _for_ an ecosystem

- **Outside-in.** The strategy lives in the ecosystem, not inside the organisation that shapes it.
  You cannot design a platform for an ecosystem that does not exist yet. "Exists" means entities
  are already trying to create and exchange value, even if clumsily.
- **Two contexts** lead teams to platform thinking. _Ecosystem mobilisation_ organises an existing
  ecosystem that performs below its potential. _Product & service innovation_ moves an existing
  offering up the value chain by organising the ecosystem that already uses it. Most real cases mix
  both, plus the organisation itself as a network.
- **Start narrow and iterate.** The scope is boundless, so each iteration focuses on a few points
  of view: one core entity and one to three relationships.

## 2. Who is in the ecosystem: entities and roles

An **entity** is any actor with objectives: a person, team, organisation or institution. Designers
**cluster** similar entities into **entity-roles** (a GP and a nurse become "healthcare
professionals"). Losing detail is deliberate, because a loosely defined role lets more of the
ecosystem take part.

Every entity-role plays one of five **platform roles**, arranged by how strategically close they are
to the owner:

| Group  | Role                    | Code | In one line                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Impact | Platform owner / shaper | PO   | Holds the vision; makes sure the strategy exists and evolves. Not necessarily the owner of the infrastructure.                 |
| Impact | External stakeholder    | ES   | Cares about the whole system (regulation, externalities, governance, distribution) rather than single interactions.            |
| Demand | Peer consumer           | PC   | Consumes the value created on the platform; can leave easily.                                                                  |
| Supply | Peer producer           | PP   | Produces value, often occasionally, and wants to become more professional. May also consume.                                   |
| Supply | Partner                 | PA   | A professional producer in a stronger, more strategic relationship with the owner; often premium or niche; sometimes a broker. |

Two rules of thumb from the guide:

- At most **five** entity-roles in the peer spectrum (PC/PP/PA).
- Ask "how many of them are there?" If you can name only one or two, they are probably stakeholders
  or partners, not peers.

## 3. The two engines

A platform strategy is the combination of two engines:

- **Transactions engine.** Channels and contexts that lower the cost of interacting, so that
  smaller, more niche exchanges become worthwhile. Transactions happen _between entities_.
- **Learning engine.** Support services through which the owner helps entities learn, improve and
  evolve in a volatile world. The platform's promise is that you learn faster _inside_ than
  _outside_. Services go _from the platform to entities_.

A **platform experience** is assembled from bricks of both engines: peer-to-peer transactions,
learning services, and complementary services.

## 4. The process

The PDT runs in four macro-phases. The toolkit covers three of them with guides:

```
Exploration ──▶ Strategy Design ──▶ Validation & Prototyping ──▶ Growth
"Is there an     "How do we design     (MVP, interviews)            "How do we launch
 opportunity?"    the platform?"                                     and scale it?"
```

### 4.1 Exploration: finding the platformization space

The fractal: **ecosystem → arenas → steps**. That is hundreds of entities, then about ten per arena,
then two to five per step.

Laid out before/after (sequence) and enabling/enabled (layer), with a FOCUS zone for the arenas you can act on. Each focus arena is broken into steps.                               |

| D2  | Portray entity-roles                          | Entity-Role Portrait                      | Per role: **potential** (assets, capabilities), **compressors** (current goals, performance pressures), **gains sought**. Gains come in three kinds: _convenience_ (easier, faster, cheaper), _access & reach_ (their "other half of the apple") and _value_ (money, recognition, knowledge…). Map what they seek _today_, not what you plan to offer. Start from potential.                                        |
| D3  | Analyse the motivations to exchange value     | Motivations Matrix                        | Row "gives to" column, for every pair, current and potential. Different types first, then the diagonal (same-type peers). Always map money, reputation and feedback. Empty cells are a signal too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| D4  | Choose the core relationships                 | —                                         | One to three key relationships (a triangle works well) and one **core entity** whose point of view comes first. Every chosen entity needs a portrait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| D5  | Identify elementary transactions and channels | Transactions Board (one per relationship) | Atomic, verb-shaped transactions. For each: direction, whether it **already happens**, the **currency or value unit**, the **channel components**, and how the channel **reduces transaction cost**. A channel is anything that makes an interaction easier: an app, an event, a template, a contract.                                                                                                              |
| D6  | Design the learning engine                    | Learning Engine Canvas                    | Per entity-role: **entry points**, then three stages (**onboarding**, **getting better**, **catching the new opportunity**), each with key **challenges** and the **services** that meet them. Also paths between roles (consumer to producer, producer to partner): an internal growth engine.                                                                                                                     |
| D7  | Assemble platform experiences                 | Platform Experience Canvas                | A named experience from the **core role's** point of view. **Steps** assembled from transactions (entity to entity), learning services (platform to entity) and other services, laid out along **channels / touchpoints**. Also the **value proposition** for the core role and, last, the **business model**: platform activities, resources and components, value provided and cost, value captured and revenues. |
| D8  | Set up the Minimum Viable Platform            | MVP Canvas                                | The experiences in the MVP, the **MVP base** (what you already have) and how it is implemented (concierge, Wizard of Oz…). Then the key assumptions (list them all first, _then_ pick the riskiest). Always test **business model**, **trust** and **attraction** assumptions, each with how the MVP tests it and an unbiased validation criterion.                                                                 |

The **Platform Design Canvas** is a one-sheet dashboard over steps D1–D6. Its areas are owners,
stakeholders, enabling services (to partners), empowering services (to peer producers), other
services (to peer consumers), core and ancillary value propositions, infrastructures and core
components, transactions, channels and contexts, partners, peer producers and peer consumers.

### 4.3 Growth: from validated experience to liquid network

Missing ones are marked "not present".                                                                                    |

The ten growth tactics for initial liquidity are: building trust, marquee strategy, single-user
value (SaaS), virality, nesting inside an existing platform, hyper-targeted marketing/SEO, remnant
inventory, scraping and automation, subsidising one side, and community or e-mail lists through
content.

## 6. What this means for a consistent model

The canvases are views over one ecosystem model. The same entity-role appears as:

- a sticky on the Ecosystem Canvas,
- a portrait,
- a row and a column of the Motivations Matrix,
- a party to transactions,
- a row of the Learning Engine,
- the core role of an experience.

That is exactly the kind of consistency a text-based, validated model can guarantee and a wall of
post-its cannot. The meta-model makes these links explicit; the canvases render them.

Each element is written once, in the home chapter of its type: the chapter of the step where the
method creates it. Later steps fill it in there or reference it, and an element discovered in a
later step is still written in its home chapter. The Ecosystem Scan (E2) maps "all the entities
involved and how these lay down on a layered market view", so entities live in E2's chapter; the
Ecosystem Canvas (D1) gives them their platform role and the portrait (D2) their context, goals and
gains, in place. A design that skips exploration still writes its entities there.
