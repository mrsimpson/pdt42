# The pdt42 meta-model

<!-- Generated from packages/core/src/schemas.ts by `pnpm docs:meta-model`. Do not edit by hand. -->

Block types as nodes, reference fields as edges. Thick arrows are required references; every
other reference is optional — but when it is set, it must point to an existing element of the
named type (rule E002). `*` marks required attributes; every block also has `id` and, where it
makes sense, `title`.
